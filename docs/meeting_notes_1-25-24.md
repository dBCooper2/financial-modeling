#### Notes from Meeting with Dr. Baidoo:

- Do more graphing
- Pick an industry, pick a job
- Add Descriptions to each of the MD files about what each thing does

- Create a test portfolio, Track it and simulate trades
    - Make the portfolio, test the CAPM, adjust after benchmarking it
- Develop a trading strategy
- Backtest that strategy
