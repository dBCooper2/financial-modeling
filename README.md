# financial-modeling: Financial Data Analysis in Python

###### This is an update to the old repository, dBI(https://github.com/dBCooper2/dBI) that introduces venvs to have a more stable programming environment so I'm not breaking things constantly

This is a set of Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts that perform analysis on financial data. The project covers connecting to API's, web scraping, building regression models, and visualizing the results of the data analysis

## Goals

- Improving my skills in Jupyter Notebooks
- Learn how to build Regression Models from Scratch: <https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling/tree/main/notebooks/modeling>
- Import Data using Yahoo Finance and TD Ameritrade APIs, as well as scraping Yahoo Finance for additional Data: <https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling/tree/main/notebooks/data_processing>
- Applying the data cleaning and modeling lessons to building regression models for stock portfolios: <https://github.com/dBCooper2/financial-modeling/tree/main/notebooks/finance>

## Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebooks containing my processes for collecting the data from their sources, processing the data in python and visualizing the data with MPLFinance and Seaborn
- Scripts taking the code from the Jupyter Notebooks that can be run from the terminal
