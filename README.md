# financial-modelling: Financial Data Analysis in Python

This is an update to the old repository, dBI(https://github.com/dBCooper2/dBI) that introduces venvs to have a more stable programming environment so I'm not breaking things constantly

## Goals

- Have a more structured workflow mixing notes and programs using Jupyter Notebooks
- Build Financial Models by connecting to different API's and libraries and processing the data
- Export the Models to SQL to be imported by Tableau to generate Visualizations
- Create Visualizations in Python after processing the data
- Track Equities in a User's Watchlist and Portfolio by interfacing with the Schwab/TD Ameritrade API

## More Info coming soon...
