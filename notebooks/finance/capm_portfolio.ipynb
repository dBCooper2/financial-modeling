    "Now that we can estimate a single position's Beta, how do we estimate a Portfolio's Beta?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Portfolio Betas (From FIN 3210)\n",
    "\n",
    "- We estimated a Portfolio's Beta by taking a weighted average of each position's Beta within the Portfolio\n",
    "    - EX: A Portfolio made up of 50% Stock A, 25% Stock B and 25% Stock C\n",
    "    - Portfolio Beta = (.5 * Beta of Stock A) + (.25 * Beta of Stock B) + (.25 * Beta of Stock C)\n",
    "- Is this applicable to the estimations of the beta, or do I need to find a new method?\n",
    "    - According to https://stablebread.com/calculate-interpret-stock-portfolio-beta/, this is the correct method\n",
