    "To measure a portfolio's results, we can use several measures to evaluate its performance. The measures covered in this notebook are the Treynor Measure, the Sharpe Ratio, the Jensen Measure, the Tracking Error, the Information Ratio, and the Sortino ratio. This Notebook will be a Pythonic representation of Dr. James Forjan's video on Modern Portfolio theory, found here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiLKoRKppY8&list=PLZkFC0ERZOdK4lmUCoF826HUskbIMS9mu&index=8>"

    "## __The Treynor Measure__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Treynor Measure is a performance metric that tracks how much __excess return__ was created for each __unit of risk__ taken on by a portfolio. It measures a fund's __return with respect to its volatility__. \n",
    "\n",
    "A higher Treynor Ratio means that the fund is performing well at a __lower risk level than the general market__\n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula for the Treynor Ratio is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Treynor\\;Ratio = \\frac{r_p - r_f}{\\beta_p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_p$ = portfolio return\n",
    "\n",
    "$r_f$ = risk-free rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\beta_p$ = beta of the portfolio\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __Usage:__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ranking __Well-Diversified Portfolios__ with different levels of risk\n",
    "- Portfolios that constitute part of an individual's personal wealth\n",

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## __The Sharpe Measure__\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Treynor Ratio, the Sharpe Maeasure is __the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility__\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Treynor Ratio only considers the systematic risk of the portfolio, while the Sharpe measure accounts for the __total risk of the portfolio__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Formula for the Sharpe Measure is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Sharpe\\;Ratio = \\frac{r_p - r_f}{\\sigma_p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(R_p)$ is the portfolio's expected return\n",
    "\n",
    "$R_f$ is the risk-free rate\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\sigma(R_p)$ is the standard deviation of returns of the portfolio\n",
    "\n",

    "#### __How do we interpret the Sharpe Ratio?__\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Portfolio with the __Highest Sharpe Ratio__ has the __best performance__\n",
    "- The Sharpe Ratio assumes the portfolio is __not__ fully diversified, nor will it be combined with other diversified portfolios\n",
    "- We should consider the Sharpe Ratio when comparing __mutually exclusive portfolios__\n",

    "The formula for Jensen's Alpha is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Jensen's\\;Alpha = \\alpha_p = R_p - [R_f + \\beta_p(R_m - R_f)]$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$R_p$ is the Actual Return\n",
    "\n",
    "$[R_f + \\beta_p(R_m - R_f)]$ is the CAPM Expected Return\n",
    "\n",
    "#### __How to Interpret Jensen's Alpha__\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Positive Alpha__ signals __superior risk-adjusted returns__, and that the manager is good at __selecting stocks__ or __predicting market turning points__\n",
    "- Jensen's Method __only accounts for systematic risk__ - It does not consider the ability of the manager to diversify\n",
    "- The values of alpha can be used to __rank portfolios/managers__, with the alpha representing the __maximum__ an investor should pay for the active management of that portfolio\n",
